## Assistant Professor of Psychology at Southeast Missouri University

Originally from Missouri, I graduated from Southeast Missouri State University (SEMO) with a B.S. in Psychology in 2016. After graduating, I moved to Fort Worth, Texas where I received my M.S. in Experimental Psychology: emphasis in Cognitive Psychology in 2019 and my Ph.D. in Experimental Psychology: emphasis in Cognitive Psychology in 2021 from Texas Christian University (TCU).
In my applied and educational-focused program of research, I conduct research aimed at 1) identifying factors that impact students' learning and learning environments, 2) developing strategies to improve students' learning, and 3) identifying pedagogical tools instructors can implement in their classes to support students' learning.
Outside of work, I usually am hanging out with my family. I have a 4-year-old son named Adam who loves to explore and has an insatiable curiosity for how things work. My favorite hobbies are playing video games, hiking, jogging, reading, and hanging out with my family.
